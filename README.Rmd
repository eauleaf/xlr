## Installation
``` r
# Development version is available here:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github('eauleaf/xlr', build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(xlr)
```

## Example

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
# Send R data to workbook
iris |> split(f = iris$Species) |> xl()
```

## Testing

Because several `xlr` functions require interactive use, reporting issues would be helpful. 

## Contribute

`xlr` has taken hundreds of hours to write, test, and re-write. If you find the package helpful, please consider paying it forward by donating to Ukraine: https://u24.gov.ua/
